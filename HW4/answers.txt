Homework 4

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

At the end, you will turn in this file along with your modified
dna_analysis.py program.

Problem 5:

G count: 5738773
C count: 5879128
A count: 7701287
T count: 7661547

Problem 6:

All of the 11 .fastq files have different A, C, G, and T counts and most of
them all have different total counts and seq lengths.  Also, all of the files
have different GC-contents and AC-contents.

test-high-gc-2 and test-moderate-gc-1 have the same Sum count of 39841 as well
as the same seq length of 40000. However their A, C, G, and T counts are
different.

sample_1 and sample_2 have the same seq length of 27000000.

test-high-gc-1, test-high-gc-2, test-moderate-gc-1, and test-moderate-gc-2 all
have the same seq length of 40000.

Problem 7:

AT/GC Ratio: 1.32234161747

Problem 8:

GC Classification: moderate GC content

Collaboration:

No one.

Reflection:

I finished most of this assignment when I did HW3 including computing all of
the outputs. So all I really had to do for this assignment was compare the
outputs, get the AT/GC ratio, and categorize organisms. For Problem 8, I
realized that I mis-calculated the AT/GC ratio because I wasn't dividing by the
total count of A, C, G, and T. So I had to fix that. So, I learned that I made
that mistake and how to correct it in order to get the correct classification.

I can't think of anything that I would do differently or any advice I would
give to future students. However, I am very happy that I worked ahead on this
assignment by finishing the calculations of all of the added output early on.
