Homework 5: Election prediction


Collaboration:

My boyfriend helped me on Problem's 1, 2, and 3.

Reflection:

This was by far the most difficult homework. I didn't need any help with the
previous 4 homework's, but this one I did. My boyfriend helped me with
Problems 1, 2, and 3 of this assignment.

The most I learned from this homework was how to create lists and dictionaries,
and also about reading from .csv files.
