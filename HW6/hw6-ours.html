<h3>
Problem 3: For Loops
</h3>

Python provides the <b>for loop</b> that can be used to simplify programs that 
contain iteration. It is a simpler way to use iteration than using while loops.
<br/>
<br/>
The general form of a <tt>for</tt> statement is:
<blockquote><code>
for <i>variable</i> in <i>sequence</i>:<br/>
<i>code block</i>
</code></blockquote>

Given the string <tt>"Python Is A Great Programming Language!"</tt>, write 
Python code using <tt>for</tt> loops and <tt>if</tt> statements to print out 
the number of vowels and constants in the string.

<h3>
Problem 4: Lists
</h3>

A list is an ordered sequence of values, where each value is identified by an 
index. A list can contain values of any type. An empty list is written as 
<tt>[]</tt>.</br>
For example, the code,<br/>
<blockquote><code>
myList = [1, 2, 3]<br/>
print myList
</code></blockquote>
produces the output,
<blockquote><code>
[1, 2, 3]
</code></blockquote>

Create a list containing the values <tt>1,2,3,5,8,2,5.2</tt>. Then write Python 
code using a loop, that prints out each element in the list and prints out the 
average value of all of the elements within the list.
